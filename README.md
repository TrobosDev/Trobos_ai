## Tobos Overview
Agent tools, on the other hand, are functions that allow the agent to perform specific tasks such analyzing your portfolio asset.
In Trobos ai :
The agent uses a tool to query Zapperâ€™s API and GPT to interpret the data / provide insights.
Tools make Trobos agents extensible and focused.
